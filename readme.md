Anime has become one of the most popularly watched mediums all over the globe. The inspiration behind this project is to provide all the anime fans with a single stop where they can access the ratings, read quotes from their favorite anime characters or even binge-watch their favorite anime series.

#  🎯 What it does
The project that we have created consists of several features and immersing experiences for anime lovers like:
 - It allows users to categorize Anime based on various constraints like whether the series is popular, highly rated, new, trending amongst all the anime series.
 - It allows users to check the ratings of each anime series and check the number of episodes in it.
 - It also allows provides descriptions for each anime series, to get a synopsis of what they can expect out of the series when they watch it.
 - The application also contains a fun section where users can generate quotes and gifs from a wide range of anime series.

# 💻 Challenges we ran into
It was hard for us to design the UI(since we didnt had any teammate having designing experties) and make a great UX,we tried our best to make things consistant 

#  📌 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We could create a basic environment where Anime lovers can interact with our application and have fun.
- We could get some hands-on experience on the front-end and back-end part of the application which matters a lot as this was our very first hackathon.
- We could work together as a team in the imposed time constraints.

# 📚  What we learned
  It was a great experience for us,we got an experience with rapid development and learned team collaboration. Since it was our first hackathon we focussed on learning as many things we can.In conclusion we can say that it was a fun experience!! 
#  ⏭ What's next for WWW - World weeb weeb
- We are planning to add more interactive elements maybe like a chatbot that can help users with more relevant Anime series.
